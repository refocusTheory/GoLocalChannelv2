== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: Is this plugin free?
A: Yes, there is no charge to use this plugin.

Q: Does UMBU change the way files are uploaded? 
A: The plugin does not alter images in any way and only uses the natural functions built into WordPress to download files and insert them into the media gallery.

Q: How many URLs can I add? 
A: You could probably add as many URLs as you wish, but it is best to keep the limits of about 20 URLs at a time.

Q: Why did you create this plugin?
A: To save time. While you can go to a post and add your media by a URL, you can only do a single URL and it will be inserted "as is" into your post meaning it will use whatever URL you copied. 

With this plugin, you can go directly to the media library and add as many URLs as you want to add them into the media library.

Q: How do I use this plugin?
A: The location of the button is on the Media Library screen.

== Known Issues ==

This plugin may conflict with anything that alters the WordPress Media Library page.
If the URL has a signature verification or lacks a file extension, WordPress does not seem to import these types of files, 
common when pulling images off private CDNs.
If the URL is lacking an extension for the filename, WordPress may not be able to download it.

Plugin conflicts:
-FileBird (tested and confirmed)
-WooCommerce Add New Product page (patched)

== Technical Details ==
Once you add in your URL(s), the plugin will download and add them to the media library.
Compatible file extensions:

== Additional Info ==

This plugin does not alter any aspect of the image or your website and uses the natural WordPress functions to download and insert media into your library.
If a URL does not exist or there is an issue with a URL, you will not receive any error, and nothing will happen.
