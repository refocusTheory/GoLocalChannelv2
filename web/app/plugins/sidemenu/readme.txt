Injects a sliding side menu / sidebar into any theme!

== Description ==
= SideMenu =

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac50F_Sufog

This plugin will inject a responsive SideMenu sidebar and menu location into your theme that you can add widgets to.

The SideMenu is opened by clicking on a menu button that you can add to any menu in your site.

When the SideMenu slides open, the entire site is dimmed and slid to the left.

The SideMenu is closed by either clicking the close icon at the top right of the SideMenu, clicking on the dimmed site or by scrolling down.

This plugin can also hijack the existing mobile menu button within your theme if required. Themes that already work with this feature are ...

* Astra
* BeTheme
* Twenty Seventeen
* Twenty Twenty-One
* OKAB
* Divi

... ask us in the [SideMenu Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/sidemenu/ "SideMenu Support Forum") to add your theme!

You can also enable a "Mega Menu" style dropdown menu feature.

= How to use the [sidemenu] shortcode =

* Use [sidemenu] to just show the default button
* Use [sidemenu]My Button Title[/sidemenu] or [sidemenu title="My Button Title"] to show the button with your own text
* Use [sidemenu class="my-class" title="Filtered SideMenu Button"] to show a button which only shows widgets or menu items with the specified class

To add a class to a menu item in "Dashboard - Appearance - Menus" click "Screen Options in the top right hand corner of the screen and tick "CSS Classes". The menu items will then show a "CSS Classes" field when expanded.

To see the class of a widget in "Dashboard - Appearance - Widgets", expand the widget that you've added to the SideMenu widget area and the class name is shown at the bottom. Since Wordpress v5.8 with the new Block Widget Editor, it's super easy to set a custom CSS class for each block, just select the block and in the block options on the right, scroll to the bottom and expand "Advanced" where you can add them into "Additional CSS class(es)".

== Installation ==

Easily use this plugin to add a SideMenu to your Wordpress website ...

1) Install "SideMenu" automatically or by uploading the ZIP file.
2) Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3) Add the SideMenu open button to an existing menu on your site in "Appearance - Menus" or by using a [sidemenu] shortcode in a widget or post.
4) Add widgets to the SideMenu sidebar in "Appearance - Widgets" or add a menu to the SideMenu display location in "Appearance - Menus".
